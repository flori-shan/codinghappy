==================================
Files vs InputStreams
When opening a workbook, either a .xls HSSFWorkbook, or a .xlsx XSSFWorkbook, the Workbook can be loaded from either a File or an InputStream. 
Using a File object allows for lower memory consumption, while an InputStream requires more memory as it has to buffer the whole file.

// Use a file
Workbook wb = WorkbookFactory.create(new File("MyExcel.xls"));

// Use an InputStream, needs more memory
Workbook wb = WorkbookFactory.create(new FileInputStream("MyExcel.xlsx"));
